## About

While many prediction problems require the use of tabular data, often, gathering sufficient training data can be a challenge task, due to costs or privacy issues.
Large language models (LLMs) offer considerable world knowledge due to their pre-training and could help improve sample efficiency for these problems.
Still, these models are often not completely aligned with many tabular prediction tasks because of model biases from pre-training and lack of information about the task, hurting their performance in the zero and few shot settings.

What if we could use task _instructions_ to help bridge this gap? That's where **TABLET** comes in. 
TABLET is a living benchmark of tabular datasets annotated with task instructions for evaluating how well LLMs utilize
instructions for improving performance on tabular prediction tasks.

To start, we've included 20 diverse classification tasks in TABLET, across domains like medical and financial.
We've additionally collected multiple instructions for each task‚Äîboth generated and naturally occurring‚Äîthat vary in 
their phrasing, granularity, and collection source.


## What can you do with TABLET?

1. **Evaluate**. TABLET provides the tools to collate tabular instances into prompts for LLMs. TABLET also makes it easy to evaluate performance across different instructions.
2. **Compare**. TABLET enables users to compare performance across LLMs in zero and few-shot settings, or against fully supervised models like XGBoost that have access to _all_ the training data.
3. **Contribute**. TABLET provides a simple API for creating new prediction tasks from tabular datasets. TABLET supports both instructions written by users and can also generate instructions for tasks.

## Tasks

Here are the current tasks in TABLET, a short description, the creator, and the number of each type of instruction. Contribute more tasks to TABLET by following the instructions in [contribute](Tablet/contribute), and I will add the task and your name and website as the person who contributed it (if you want).
